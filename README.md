# Send emails from a csv file
Send emails from a dataset
The Python code that I provided earlier is used to send emails to a list of recipients stored in a CSV file. Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:

1.The CSV library is imported, which allows the code to read and parse CSV files.

2.The SMTP library is imported, which allows the code to connect to and send emails through a SMTP server.

3.The MIMEText library is imported, which allows the code to create email messages in a format that can be sent through an SMTP server.

4.The code opens the "recipients.csv" file and reads the email addresses into a list using the CSV library.

5.The code connects to the Gmail SMTP server and logs in using a Gmail account and password.

6.The code creates a new email message using the MIMEText library, with a subject and body specified in the code. The sender's email address is also set.

7.The code enters a loop, where it sends the email message to each recipient in the list. The recipient's email address is set as the "To" field of the message.

8.After all of the emails have been sent, the code closes the connection to the SMTP server.
