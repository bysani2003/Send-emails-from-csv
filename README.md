# Send emails from a csv file
Send emails from a dataset
The Python code provided earlier is used to send emails to a list of recipients stored in a CSV file. This can be useful if you have a large number of email addresses and you want to send the same message to all of them.

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. The CSV library allows the code to read and parse CSV files, which are a common way to store data in a tabular format. The SMTP library enables the code to connect to and send emails through a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, which is a type of server that sends and receives emails. The MIMEText library allows the code to create email messages in a format that can be sent through an SMTP server.

Next, the code opens the "recipients.csv" file and reads the email addresses into a list using the CSV library. It then connects to the Gmail SMTP server using the SMTP library and logs in using a Gmail account and password.

Once connected to the server, the code creates a new email message using the MIMEText library and sets the subject, body, and sender's email address of the message. The subject is the title of the email, the body is the main content of the email, and the sender's email address is the email address that the email will be sent from.

After the email message has been created, the code enters a loop where it sets the recipient's email address as the "To" field of the message and sends the email using the SMTP server. This is done for each email address in the list.

Finally, after all of the emails have been sent, the code closes the connection to the SMTP server. This is important because it ensures that all of the emails have been sent and received properly, and it frees up resources on the server.
